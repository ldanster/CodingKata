Your task is to welcome your guests properly: 
Some are female and some were knighted by the queen.
So greet them correctly – or this will be your last hosting.

For example:
-Jane Austen is a women, so say Hello Ms. Austen
-George Orwell is a man, so say Hello Mr. Orwell
-Isaac Newton was knighted, so say Hello Sir Newton

Good luck with your party!
